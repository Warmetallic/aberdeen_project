Song No. 1516

8 Farewell to your sorrows, drink it round with a glass,
Drink a health to each lad, and his sweet smiling lass;
Drink a health to each lover whose loved one is true,
Here’s good health, peace and plenty, so farewell and adieu.

1 Come all my old comrades once more let us join,
Let us join all our voices to muse on langsyne,
Let us drink and be merry from sorrow refrain,
For we may and may never meet all here again.

2 The time is now approaching when I must away,
So I leave my best wishes with all you that stay,
May good fortune attend you who happy lives here,
For away to America my course I must steer.
